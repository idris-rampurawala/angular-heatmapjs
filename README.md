# AngularHeatmapjs

> This project is a [Heatmap.js](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/) implementation in Angular. Key feature includes heatmap click insights.

## Background

Heatmaps over an image is a new thing in web development. [Patrick's](https://github.com/pa7) heatmap.js is great tool to generate heatmap on an image easily. I have created this repository for Angular developers to easily integrate heatmap.js in angular projects.

One key feature that I have implemented is a **mouse-over click on heatmap**. Visit this [link](https://idris-rampurawala.github.io/angular-heatmapjs/) to see it in action!
